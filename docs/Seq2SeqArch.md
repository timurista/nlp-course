## Seq2Seq
Draw back or limitation a yes / no response is only a start. 

## Issues with bag of words model
Fixed-size input
(we need a large number of elements into then nueral network)

Doesn't take work order into account.

## Sentences
Is the cat shorter than the dog. You can jumble text in email but the model will change the model.

Issue with bag of words model
  - fixed-size input
  - doesn't take word order into account
  - fixed size output

## How do we solve this?
RNNs
  - recurrent nueral networks
  - stochastic gradient descent
  - backpropogation
    - starting from now

## Different types of NN architecture
layer of nuerons is a box
if we want more than one response we need a many to many response.
So we may have the same input but not necessarily the same output.
Code them as a vector
  Hello is position 5, so we put it in 5.
  INstead of counting recurrence of every word...
    we just add them with numerical or position the thing is associated with.
  Size of vector depends on how long email is


## EOS vs SOS
we feed in values of hello, the email words feed into the system through time.

memory cell, then we get new inputs and new outputs
then
